## 🎮 Gameplay

- The game ends if the bird hits a pipe or touches the top or bottom of the screen.
- The score increases each time you pass a pipe.



## 🚦 Difficulty Modes

The game includes three selectable difficulty modes that affect the **pipe gap shrinking rate**:

| Difficulty      | Description                                                | Pipe Gap Behavior                         |
|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| 🟢 Normal       | Balanced for casual play                                   | Constant pipe gap (no shrinking).         |
| 🔴 Hard         | More challenging; pipes narrow over time                   | Pipe gap shrinks by **2px** per score.    |
| 🔥 Extra Hard   | Intense mode for skilled players                           | Pipe gap shrinks by **5px** per score.    |
